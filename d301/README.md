# Class 10: Scrolling
In this session, we'll discuss the purpose and value of leveraging scrolling in a visualization, and create an implementation using D3.js.

**Today's Objectives**
- Discuss the potential impact of **scrolling**
- Understand how to leverage `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS` to easily build a scroller
- Create scroll events on our charts 
- Work on final projects

## Discussion

Before diving into the details of building scrollers, lets take a few minutes to discuss the purpose (and possibilities) of using scrolling in our visualizations. See [slides](class10.pdf).

## Lab 1
In our lab today, we'll implement a set of scrolling transitions on a scatterplot. See [lab-1](lab-1/).

## Final Projects
We'll dedicate a portion of class today to working on and sharing our final projects. Why don't we check-in on the following questions:

- What is the status of your project?
- What have you learned how to do thus far?
- What challenges do you anticipate in the coming week?

## For Tuesday
Keep working on your final projects!
